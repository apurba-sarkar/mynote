# Title: Enhanced Notepad Application with Real-time Database Integration

Introduction:
Our project aims to develop a feature-rich notepad application with enhanced functionality, leveraging modern technologies such as React Toolkit and Supabase. This notepad provides a seamless user experience with basic note-taking capabilities while incorporating advanced features like live reflection, word limitations, custom sliders, and mobile screen responsiveness. We have prioritized user convenience by integrating delete and stale features, ensuring efficient management of notes. By utilizing a combination of Vanilla CSS, Ant Design (AntD), React-Toast, and React Query, we've tailored a robust solution that meets the demands of modern note-taking applications.

## Key Features:

Basic Functionality: The notepad offers essential note-taking features, allowing users to create, edit, and save notes effortlessly.

Real-time Database Integration: All notes are stored in a database using Supabase, ensuring data persistence and enabling live reflection. Users can access their notes from any device with an internet connection.

Word Limitations: Users can set word limitations for their notes, with visual indicators to track their progress. This feature enhances productivity by encouraging concise writing (400words).

Custom Slider: A customizable slider allows users to adjust settings such as font size, line spacing, or other preferences to personalize their note-taking experience.

Delete and Stale Features: The application includes options to delete notes and manage stale content effectively. This ensures users can maintain a clutter-free workspace.

Mobile Screen Responsiveness: The application is optimized for mobile devices, offering a seamless experience across various screen sizes and orientations.
